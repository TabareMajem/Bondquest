      difficultConversations: `I notice you're scoring \${variables.scoreLevel} in \${variables.dimension}. This dimension measures \${variables.description}.

      Having difficult conversations is an important part of any relationship. Here are some strategies tailored for your relationship stage (\${variables.relationshipLength}):
      
      1. Choose a neutral time when neither of you is stressed or tired
      2. Use "I feel" statements instead of "you" statements
      3. Take breaks if emotions get too intense
      4. Actively listen without planning your response
      
      What specific conversation topic has been most challenging for you and your partner?`,

      activeListing: `Based on your \${variables.scoreLevel} score in \${variables.dimension}, I'd like to suggest some active listening techniques.

      Active listening is about fully focusing on what your partner is saying rather than just waiting for your turn to speak. Try these exercises:
      
      1. The Speaker-Listener technique: One person speaks while the other listens without interrupting, then summarizes what they heard before responding
      2. Ask open-ended questions that can't be answered with yes/no
      3. Show non-verbal cues that you're listening (nodding, eye contact)
      
      Which of these feels most doable for you to practice this week?`,

      emotionalIntimacy: `Your \${variables.scoreLevel} score in \${variables.dimension} shows that emotional intimacy is an area where focused attention could strengthen your bond.

      Emotional intimacy is built through gradually sharing more vulnerable thoughts and feelings. Here are some exercises designed for your relationship stage:
      
      1. Daily emotional check-ins (10 minutes sharing honest feelings)
      2. "High-Low" sharing (each person shares their highest and lowest moment of the day)
      3. Vulnerability practice (share something slightly uncomfortable once a week)
      
      What's one small step you could take this week to deepen your emotional connection?`,

      needsExpression: `Looking at your \${variables.scoreLevel} score in \${variables.dimension}, expressing needs clearly might help you both feel more supported.

      Many couples struggle with clearly expressing their needs without criticism. Try:
      
      1. Using the formula: "When [situation], I feel [emotion], and I need [specific request]"
      2. Practicing "appreciation before request" - share something you appreciate before making a request
      3. Setting aside 15 minutes weekly for a needs-sharing conversation
      
      Which need have you been hesitant to express to your partner?`

    systemPrompt: `You are Casanova, BondQuest's romance and fun specialist.

    Your expertise is in helping couples maintain passion, playfulness, and enjoy shared experiences together.
    
    Your communication style is charismatic, enthusiastic, and creative. You're playful in your responses
    and focus on the importance of fun and excitement in relationships. You believe that maintaining
    romance and adventure is essential for long-term relationship satisfaction.
    
    When advising users:
    - Suggest creative date ideas and relationship games
    - Offer tips for maintaining physical intimacy and romance

      dateIdeas: `Based on your \${variables.scoreLevel} score in \${variables.dimension}, I'd like to suggest some date ideas that could help strengthen this aspect of your relationship.

      Great dates aren't just about where you go, but about creating opportunities for genuine connection. Here are some ideas tailored to your interests (\${variables.interests}):
      
      1. "Mystery Date Night" - Take turns planning surprise dates for each other
      2. "Skill Share Evening" - Teach each other something you're good at
      3. "Nostalgia Date" - Recreate your first date or another special memory
      4. "Adventure Challenge" - Try something new together that pushes your comfort zones
      
      Which of these sounds most appealing to try this week?`,

      intimacyBuilding: `Your \${variables.scoreLevel} score in \${variables.dimension} suggests that focusing on building physical intimacy could strengthen your connection.

      Physical intimacy isn't just about sex - it's about creating a sense of closeness through touch. Here are some exercises designed to build comfort and connection:
      
      1. The 6-second kiss (greeting and parting with a 6-second kiss changes your connection)
      2. 2-minute daily hugs (longer hugs release bonding hormones)
      3. "Touch menu" creation (listing different types of touch you both enjoy)
      
      Physical connection often deepens when emotional safety is established first. What small step could you take to increase non-sexual touch this week?`,

      reignitingSpark: `Looking at your \${variables.scoreLevel} score in \${variables.dimension}, you might benefit from some ideas to reignite the spark in your relationship.

      It's completely normal for passion to ebb and flow in long-term relationships. The key is being intentional about rekindling it. Try:
      
      1. The "3x3 desire building" exercise (share 3 things that build desire for you outside the bedroom, 3 things during foreplay, and 3 things during intimacy)
      2. "Desire mapping" - track when you feel most connected and identify patterns
      3. Create a "fantasy box" where you both add ideas for intimate experiences
      
      Remember, anticipation is powerful for desire. How might you create more anticipation in your relationship?`,

      surpriseIdeas: `Your \${variables.scoreLevel} score in \${variables.dimension} shows you're doing well! Here are some surprise ideas to keep things fresh.

      Surprises create novelty, which is essential for maintaining excitement. Based on your interests (\${variables.interests}), consider:
      
      1. Hidden notes with things you love about your partner
      2. "Yes Day" - saying yes to all reasonable requests from your partner for a day
      3. Surprise memory recreation (recreating an important moment in your relationship)
      4. "Appreciation ambush" - unexpectedly sharing specific things you appreciate about them
      
      The best surprises show you've been paying attention to what matters to them. What's something your partner has mentioned wanting to do that you could surprise them with?`

      relationshipAssessment: `Based on your \${variables.scoreLevel} score in \${variables.dimension}, I'd like to help you understand what might be happening.

      Research suggests that \${variables.dimension} typically develops through several stages. Your current score indicates you may be experiencing challenges with:
      
      - The foundation elements needed for \${variables.dimension}
      - Consistent practice of behaviors that build \${variables.dimension}
      - Potential barriers such as \${variables.challenges}
      
      Looking at your relationship length (\${variables.relationshipLength}), this is a common growth area. What specific aspect of \${variables.dimension} feels most challenging right now?`,

      patternIdentification: `Your \${variables.scoreLevel} score in \${variables.dimension} suggests there might be some patterns worth exploring.

      Looking at the data, couples often develop unconscious patterns that either strengthen or undermine their bond. Common patterns related to \${variables.dimension} include:
      
      1. The "pursue-withdraw" cycle (one partner seeks connection while the other creates distance)
      2. "Emotional bid" responses (turning toward, away from, or against requests for connection)
      3. "Four Horsemen" communication patterns (criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling)
      
      Identifying these patterns is the first step to changing them. Does any of this sound familiar in your relationship?`,

      goalSetting: `Based on your \${variables.scoreLevel} score in \${variables.dimension}, setting specific goals could help improve this area.

      Research shows that relationship goals are most effective when they are:
      1. Specific and measurable
      2. Focused on behaviors rather than outcomes
      3. Achievable within a reasonable timeframe
      4. Tracked consistently
      
      For \${variables.dimension}, consider setting a goal like: "We will spend 20 minutes each day sharing our thoughts and feelings without distractions" or "We will express appreciation to each other at least once daily."
      
      What specific, measurable goal would you like to set for improving \${variables.dimension}?`,

      habitBuilding: `Your \${variables.scoreLevel} score in \${variables.dimension} suggests that building consistent habits could strengthen this area.

      Relationship research shows that small, consistent habits have more impact than grand gestures. For \${variables.dimension}, consider adopting these evidence-based habits:
      
      1. The "daily temperature reading" (5 minutes sharing appreciations, new information, puzzles, concerns, and wishes)
      2. "Micro-moments of connection" (6 brief daily positive interactions)
      3. "Rituals of connection" (creating meaningful routines that you both value)
      
      It takes approximately 66 days to form a new habit. Which of these would be most doable to maintain for the next two months?`,

      relationshipMaintenance: `Your \${variables.scoreLevel} score in \${variables.dimension} shows you're doing well! Let's focus on maintenance strategies.

      Research on relationship maintenance reveals that successful couples:
      
      1. Regularly update their understanding of each other as they grow and change
      2. Maintain a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions
      3. Address small issues before they become major problems
      4. Continue to learn new skills and strategies even when things are going well
      
      For \${variables.dimension} specifically, what maintenance strategy would help you sustain your current success?`
