Okay, that's a common issue when there's a mismatch between the model name, the API version, and the available methods. The error message [404 Not Found] models/gemini-pro is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent tells you exactly that: the server couldn't find gemini-pro at the v1beta endpoint path, or that specific model doesn't support generateContent under that version (which is unlikely for Gemini Pro, suggesting the first part is the problem).
Here's a breakdown of the likely causes and how to fix them:
Model Name Changed/Incorrect: Google often updates model names as they move from preview/beta to stable versions. The standard production-ready model is now often referred to differently.
Fix: Try using gemini-1.0-pro instead of gemini-pro. This is the most common fix.
API Version Deprecated/Changed: The v1beta endpoint might be outdated for the gemini-pro (or its newer equivalent) model. The stable version is usually v1.
Fix: Change the API endpoint version in your URL from v1beta to v1.
Combination of Both: You might need to update both the model name and the API version.
Troubleshooting Steps:
Check the Official Documentation: This is the most reliable step. Go to the Google AI Gemini API documentation and find the section on available models and how to call them. Look for the correct model identifier (gemini-1.0-pro, gemini-1.5-pro-latest, etc.) and the corresponding API endpoint version (v1, v1beta, etc.) for the generateContent method.
Link: Google AI Gemini REST API Reference (Look under generativelanguage.models)
Modify Your Request URL/Code:
Likely Correct URL Structure: Based on current standards, your URL should probably look like this (using v1 and gemini-1.0-pro):
https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-1.0-pro:generateContent?key=YOUR_API_KEY
Use code with caution.
(Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual key)
If using an SDK (Python, Node.js, etc.):
Python: Ensure you are initializing the model correctly:
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
# Use the likely correct model name
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.0-pro')
# Or potentially the latest 1.5 pro if needed and available
# model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro-latest')

try:
    response = model.generate_content("Your prompt here")
    print(response.text)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}") # Check error details
Use code with caution.
Python
Node.js:
const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require("@google/generative-ai");

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI("YOUR_API_KEY");

async function run() {
  // Use the likely correct model name
  const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-1.0-pro" });
  // Or potentially the latest 1.5 pro
  // const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-1.5-pro-latest" });

  const prompt = "Your prompt here";

  try {
    const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
    const response = await result.response;
    const text = response.text();
    console.log(text);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating content:", error); // Check error details
  }
}
run();
Use code with caution.
JavaScript
Update your SDK: Ensure you have the latest version of the Google Generative AI SDK:
Python: pip install --upgrade google-generativeai
Node.js: npm update @google/generative-ai
Verify API Key and Enabled API:
Double-check that your API key is correct.
Go to your Google Cloud Console project associated with the API key.
Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library".
Search for "Generative Language API" (it might also appear as Vertex AI API depending on how you set it up, but for Google AI Studio keys, it's usually the former).
Ensure this API is Enabled for your project.
In summary, the most probable fix is to change your request to use the v1 API version and the gemini-1.0-pro model name. Check the documentation to be certain for the specific features you need.
