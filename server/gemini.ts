      1. communication: Communication patterns, openness, and clarity
      2. trust: Level of security, reliability, and honesty

      6. shared_values: Alignment on core values and future goals
      7. fun_playfulness: Ability to enjoy lighthearted moments and activities together
      8. mutual_support: How they provide encouragement and respect
      9. independence_balance: Balance between autonomy and togetherness
      10. overall_satisfaction: General contentment with the relationship
      
      Also extract these standard identifiers:
